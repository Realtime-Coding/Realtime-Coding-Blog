Nowadays Git is included in every project we created on android studio so there must be some files or directories which we don’t want to share on a remote repository and prefer to keep safe on our local machine in that case .gitignore file comes to the rescue.

.gitignore file tells VCS, the files/directory path mentioned in the .gitignore file, don’t need to upload to the remote repository so on the safe side files ignored while pushing code to the remote repository.

I am sharing already made template for android so you can just copy and paste it to save time and search for ignoring less important and sensitive files to remote repository 


```groovy
# Gradle files
.gradle/
build/

# Local configuration file (sdk path, etc)
local.properties

# Log/OS Files
*.log

# Android Studio generated files and folders
captures/
.externalNativeBuild/
.cxx/
*.apk
output.json

# IntelliJ
*.iml
.idea/
misc.xml
deploymentTargetDropDown.xml
render.experimental.xml

# Keystore files
*.jks
*.keystore

# Google Services (e.g. APIs or Firebase)
google-services.json

# Android Profiling
*.hprof
```
